## 🧠 Engineering Decisions (The Real Story)

This project intentionally prioritizes **clarity, resilience, and learnability** over shortcuts.

### 1. Why Expo + React Native Web

**Decision**
- Single codebase for web-first delivery
- Expo for fast iteration and native parity
- React Native Web to avoid duplicating UI logic

**Tradeoff**
- Web storage limits (AsyncStorage quota)
- Style warnings (`shadow*`, `pointerEvents`) on web

**Outcome**
- One UI system, predictable behavior across platforms
- Issues surfaced early instead of post-launch

---

### 2. Local-Only Storage (On Purpose)

**Decision**
- No backend
- No authentication
- No remote state

All user data lives in `AsyncStorage`.

**Challenges**
- Browser quota exceeded when storing images as base64
- Async race conditions during profile updates
- Reset logic needing to be atomic and safe

**Fixes**
- Stored image URIs instead of raw image blobs
- Centralized storage access via a single `store.ts`
- Explicit reset flow with confirmation modal

---

### 3. Navigation & Layout Bugs (and Lessons)

**What went wrong**
- Bottom tab bar overlapping content
- Inconsistent padding across screens
- Custom tab bar component causing `undefined` render errors
- Double headers due to mixed navigator configs

**How it was fixed**
- Standardized `contentContainerStyle` padding across screens
- Introduced a single source of truth for bottom spacing
- Carefully aligned tab bar height with scroll padding
- Refactored custom TabBar exports (named vs default mismatch)

**Lesson**
> Navigation bugs aren’t visual problems — they’re architectural ones.

---

### 4. Styling for Calm, Not Cleverness

**Decision**
- Soft shadows, rounded cards, low-contrast accents
- Minimal animation
- No aggressive gradients or dopamine loops

**Technical note**
- Replaced deprecated `shadow*` styles with `boxShadow` for web
- Accepted non-critical dev warnings to preserve design intent

---

## 🐛 What Broke Along the Way

This project went through **real failure states**, including:

- ❌ Blank screen due to bundler OOM errors  
- ❌ MIME type errors caused by failed web transforms  
- ❌ Duplicate function declarations (`setProfile`)  
- ❌ Unicode escape issues in copied code  
- ❌ AsyncStorage quota crashes  
- ❌ Invalid JSX elements from mis-exported components  

Each one was debugged systematically:
- Reading stack traces *fully*
- Fixing root causes, not silencing errors
- Restarting the mental model when needed

**Steps:**
```bash
npm install

npx expo export:web
